# Firebase API
Run `npm i` inside of the main folder and the functions folder.  
Be sure to install the firebase tools onto your computer with `npm i firebase-tools -g`.  
Now you can run the firestore with `npm run serve` while in the functions folder.  

## Deploying
First you have to run `firebase login` to log in to your hark email. If you don't have access 
and think you should, contact kevin.xu@hark.tv.  
After logging in, run `npm run deploy` to deploy the code to the live server.
